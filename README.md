# Messaging-App
We are creating an app, similar to that of WhatsApp, which allows users to communicate with one another. This app will involve many features, including the ability to create accounts and login, add contacts, change themes and more! There will likely be a page which allows users to type in usernames of other users and send them friend requests or block them. We also plan in the contact or direct messages area to display all friendsâ€™ usernames and the most recent sent message under their username. In the settings area, the user will also be able to change their pfp, and upon doing so, all friends will view that updated and new pfp. Will also make it so that you are required to type in an eight letter password at the minimum when creating an account.
